# Phishing-Game
## Short description
This is a game created to raise awareness and teach the un-aware of phishing attempts to make phishing attempts in the workplace less likely. Ultimately we try to simulate a relatable real-life work environemnt with a similar looking email client to real life and office as to make the user comfortable. Then we test their skills by giving them different types of obfuscations per level to be able to spot any type of obfuscation spotted in real-life and use what they've learnt from playing this game to identify legit URLS to phishing attempt URLS.
